# MERCUR-UI-BASELINE.md

**Status: SOURCE AUDIT COMPLETE / CLEAN SURFACES OWNER-VERIFIED.**
P01-specific UI implementation remains governed by
`P01-IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md`. **Source:** alirezasefidpour747/mercur,
native commit `296b5968eac620d3cb689ae130a6a2aa382c9941`; current
checkout includes the existing baseline documentation commit
`46969fddcae50059b8946b79f4ebf5c3ef323efe`. **Runtime:** owner verified
API `:9000`, Storefront `:3000`, Admin `:7001` and Vendor `:7002` on the
clean local baseline. This file remains a source/UI mapping audit rather
than P01 implementation evidence.

## 1. Inputs and scope

Reviewed UI-FOUNDATION, B2B-STOREFRONT-UX, DIDAR-OPERATIONS-CONSOLE,
WORK-ADDENDUM-UI, UI-SPEC-INDEX and the supplied Master/MD Index copies.
Product and Reporting documents remain at their previously read current
file versions 2 and 3. B2B-RBAC was inspected for Product Ops, supplier
product entry, retailer catalog, organization scope, workflow-state
restrictions and audit boundaries.

The UI specifications describe the eventual platform. P01 includes
category/product discovery, supplier Product/Offer entry and Product
Operations review/publication only. Their full-platform Definitions of
Done do not pull Orders, Finance, WMS or other workspaces into P01.

## 3. Backend behavior that changes UI mapping

1.  Native Offer references both Product and Variant, with seller/SKU
    uniqueness and product/variant/seller indexes. Keep these
    identities.
2.  `workflows/offer/workflows/create-offers.ts` requires inventory
    items; vendor validators also require positive prices. The reusable
    native Offer model/service/creation step is separable from this
    ecommerce workflow.
3.  `confirm-products.ts` requires PROPOSED and changes native status to
    PUBLISHED. Approval/publication cannot be inferred from the button
    label alone.
4.  `request-product-change.ts` records a CHANGE_REQUESTED action but
    leaves native Product status PROPOSED. Persist a Didar review state
    explicitly.
5.  `auto-confirm-product-change.ts` auto-confirms when PRODUCT_REQUEST
    is disabled. Configure that flag for Didar and guard every
    alternative mutation path.
6.  Vendor Product ownership helpers use PRODUCT_ADD audit with
    `created_by = sellerId`. Preserve native ownership compatibility and
    separately persist actual acting user/organization.
7.  Native store Offer defaults expose supplier identity, stocked
    quantity and internal metadata. A safe new screen does not make
    those existing APIs safe.
8.  Native permission middleware grants all when no resolver is
    configured. P01 requires real, fail-closed Product permissions and
    organization membership.

Evidence: `packages/core/src/modules/offer/models/offer.ts`,
`api/vendor/offers/validators.ts`, `api/store/offers/query-config.ts`,
`api/vendor/products/helpers.ts`, `api/utils/permissions-middleware.ts`,
`workflows/product` and `workflows/product-edit`.

## 4. UI compatibility findings

Existing documentation `docs/UI-ARCHITECTURE.md` describes host route
overrides, compound page components, widget zones and dashboard
primitives. Source confirms these extension points. They are the
preferred application boundary.

The storefront has useful catalog structure but its default business
composition is unsuitable for retailer requests. In particular,
offers/buybox, region-dependent pricing, swallowed fetch errors and
client/subset price sorting must not carry into Didar discovery.

Native Custom Fields synchronize schema during loader startup
(`modules/custom-fields/loaders.ts`). For migration-controlled, indexed,
report-critical Didar catalog fields, prefer an explicit linked module
rather than silent boot-time DDL.

## 5. P01 verification required after implementation

Both retailer and supplier-to-Product-Ops journeys need real API tests,
browser tests, backend failure states, direct refresh, backend
restart/persistence, permission and bypass tests. The UI matrix is
fa/ar/en/fr × 375/768/1280/1920 pixel viewports. Fonts are Vazirmatn,
IBM Plex Sans Arabic and Inter as specified. Verify lang, dir, font,
navigation, filters, drawers/dialogs, tables, dates/numbers and LTR
Product codes inside RTL pages.

No screenshot, source audit or owner-confirmed native runtime marks P01
PASSED. P01 code remains NOT STARTED pending implementation-map review.

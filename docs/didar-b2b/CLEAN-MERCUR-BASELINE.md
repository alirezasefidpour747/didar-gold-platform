-   link synchronization and migration scripts completed;
-   Redis connections established;
-   native Mercur seed completed;
-   5 demo Sellers, 50 demo Products and 1144 demo Offers seeded;
-   Publishable API key created;
-   `/health` returned HTTP 200;
-   Store API enforced Publishable API Key and responded correctly with
    the key;
-   API started on `:9000`;
-   Storefront started on `:3000` with real seeded API data;
-   Admin host started on `:7001`;
-   Vendor host started on `:7002`.

Observed non-blocking baseline warnings:

-   workflow-engine Redis `url` deprecation;
-   migration-time codegen warning `mercurjs: command not found`;
-   unnamed product-change workflow `when` warning;
-   PostgreSQL client nested-query deprecation during seed.

Do not patch these merely to silence warnings; track them unless they
cause a real failure.

## Earlier source audit

## 1. Native capabilities present

This is a source audit of the supplied fork, not proof that its runtime
works.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Area                                Native implementation and evidence
  ----------------------------------- ----------------------------------------
  Monorepo                            Bun workspaces and Turborepo: `apps/*`,
                                      `packages/*`, `packages/providers/*`,
                                      integration and E2E workspaces. Root
                                      `package.json`, `turbo.json`.

  Backend                             `apps/api`: Medusa application using
                                      `withMercur`; `packages/core`:
                                      marketplace plugin. Declared Medusa
                                      packages/overrides: **2.21.0**. Mercur:
                                      **2.3.6-canary.6**.

  Frontend/Admin/Vendor               React/Vite dashboard libraries in
                                      `packages/admin`, `packages/vendor`;
                                      hosts in `apps/admin-test` (dev 7001)
                                      and `apps/vendor` (dev 7002). API config
                                      disables embedded dashboard serving. The
                                      README's scaffold URLs do not describe
                                      these host settings.

  Storefront                          `apps/storefront`: Next.js **15.5.24**,
                                      React 19; existing B2C catalog, product
                                      detail, cart and checkout. This is not
                                      yet the restricted Didar B2B frontend.

  Mercur modules                      Seller, Offer, Product Attribute,
                                      Product Edit, Review, Commission,
                                      Payout, Promotion Cost, Media, Custom
                                      Fields, Admin UI, Vendor UI and Codegen
                                      under `packages/core/src/modules`.

  Product/Variant                     Medusa Product/Variant, category
                                      hierarchy, images/options and catalog
                                      APIs; Mercur attributes and product
                                      review/change workflows. Native Offer
                                      requires `product_id` and `variant_id`:
                                      keep a minimal native Variant under each
                                      initial Didar Product instead of
                                      inventing another SKU hierarchy.

  Seller/Vendor                       Seller, Member, SellerMember and
                                      invitations. SellerMember carries
                                      `role_id` and owner flag. Membership is
                                      checked against authenticated actor plus
                                      seller context, including
                                      client-provided `x-seller-id`.

  Supplier Offers                     Native Offer holds
                                      seller/product/variant IDs, SKU,
                                      inventory/backorder flags and lead time;
                                      links to prices, inventory and shipping
                                      profile. Multiple sellers can offer the
                                      same Product/Variant. This is the
                                      preferred reuse candidate.

  Cart/Order                          Medusa cart/order plus Mercur
                                      `completeCartWithSplitOrdersWorkflow`,
                                      OrderGroup, seller order links and
                                      line-item Offer links. Checkout creates
                                      seller orders and reservations; it is
                                      not the Didar request/proforma
                                      acceptance workflow.

  Inventory                           Native inventory items, levels,
                                      reservations and stock locations; seller
                                      inventory/location links and Offer
                                      inventory links. Quantity inventory is
                                      not UID-level physical-piece identity.

  Fulfillment                         Native shipping profiles, options,
                                      fulfillment sets/service zones; Mercur
                                      seller-scoped fulfillment
                                      creation/cancellation. Does not
                                      establish Didar package/UID/invoice/OTP
                                      custody semantics.

  Auth                                Medusa auth with user/customer/member
                                      actors; vendor session/bearer
                                      authentication and seller membership
                                      checks. Mercur permission catalog, route
                                      guards and resolver interface exist.
                                      Without a configured permission
                                      resolver, `resolvePermissionsMiddleware`
                                      grants all catalog permissions and marks
                                      enforcement false.

  API routes                          File-based `route.ts` and
                                      middleware/query/validator files.
                                      Existing families: `/admin/products`,
                                      `/admin/offers`, `/admin/sellers`,
                                      `/vendor/products`, `/vendor/offers`,
                                      `/store/products`, `/store/offers`,
                                      `/store/carts/:id/complete`,
                                      `/store/order-groups`; native Medusa
                                      commerce/auth routes also participate.

  Database/Migrations                 PostgreSQL; Medusa DML/services and
                                      MikroORM module migrations, plus
                                      declarative cross-module links.
                                      Checked-in Mercur migrations reside
                                      under each module's `migrations`. Use
                                      Medusa migration/link tooling; no
                                      hand-maintained parallel commerce
                                      schema.

  Redis                               API config selects Redis cache, event
                                      bus, workflow engine and locking
                                      providers. Redis and PostgreSQL are
                                      runtime prerequisites.

  Seed                                `apps/api` script `seed` runs
                                      `medusa exec ./src/scripts/seed.ts`:
                                      marketplace demo sellers, catalog,
                                      offers, regions, stock and shipping
                                      setup. It is not the P01 Didar seed.

  Tests                               Jest/SWC unit and HTTP integration
                                      suites in `integration-tests`;
                                      app-specific Jest scripts; Playwright
                                      E2E and guide suites in `e2e-tests`. CI
                                      uses Bun 1.3.8, Node 20, PostgreSQL 15
                                      and Redis 7.

## 2. Specifications that can build on native capabilities

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Specification                       Native foundation; remaining Didar
                                      boundary
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  PRODUCT-CORE                        Category hierarchy,
                                      Product/Variant, Seller, Offer,
                                      attributes, review and dashboards.
                                      Add gold/commercial fields,
                                      reporting history and restricted
                                      B2B projections.

  B2B-RBAC / AUTH-OTP-SECURITY        Existing authentication, seller
                                      membership and permission extension
                                      points. Add enforceable Didar
                                      roles, retailer organization
                                      membership/scope and
                                      resource-specific OTP security.

  PHYSICAL-INTAKE / SUPPLY-ORDER      Reuse stable Product/Variant/Seller
                                      references; these business
                                      processes need dedicated records.

  PACKAGING-FULFILLMENT /             Reuse fulfillment/shipping
  DISPATCH-DELIVERY                   primitives where their meaning
                                      fits; add invoice manifest,
                                      physical packages, tracking and
                                      custody workflow.

  WAREHOUSE-INVENTORY                 Native
                                      inventory/location/reservation can
                                      underpin the optional future
                                      package. It remains **Optional /
                                      Deferred**, never an automatic
                                      prerequisite.

  AGENT-OPERATIONS                    Reuse actor/auth and product/order
                                      references; agent bags,
                                      assignments, custody and authorized
                                      sales need Didar records.

  SETTLEMENT-CORE / INVOICE-BILLING   Reuse native commerce references;
                                      native currency payments/payouts do
                                      not provide the authoritative
                                      18K-gold ledger or UID-linked
                                      invoices.

  NOTIFICATION                        Reuse Medusa notification/provider
                                      and event patterns after
                                      configuration; SMS/in-app delivery
                                      and OTP behavior need explicit
                                      implementation.

  REPORTING-FOUNDATION                Stable IDs/links and timestamps
                                      exist; required organization/actor
                                      context, append-oriented audit and
                                      status history need additions.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Read: MASTER-B2B-FLOW and MD-INDEX dated 2026-09-30,
REPORTING-FOUNDATION current file version 3, PRODUCT-CORE current file
version 2.

The Master and Product specification reference ORDER-CORE, but MD-INDEX
and the numbered execution list omit an Order Core package. Before
scheduling request/proforma/supply integration: **OWNER DECISION
REQUIRED** on its package position. This does not prevent isolated P01
after the baseline gate passes.

## 3. Where extensions are required

-   Preserve native Product and Offer identity. Prefer linked,
    structured extensions for karat/product code, supplier weight
    ranges, making-fee basis/ranges, internal availability and actor
    context. Evaluate native Custom Fields against
    migration/query/validation requirements before choosing it; do not
    put report-critical relationships only in free-form metadata.
-   Add allowlisted retailer catalog DTOs and server-side restrictions
    on discovery, expansions, caches and exports. Existing
    `store/offers/query-config.ts` exposes seller identity and stocked
    quantity, and Product defaults include metadata/variants. Adding a
    safe new screen alone does not secure the old routes.
-   Reuse native review/change workflows where compatible, while
    preserving Didar approval/publication meaning and auditable
    transitions. The product-request feature flag affects permitted
    vendor statuses; its required configuration must be verified.
-   Add organization-aware queries and mutations. Seller membership is a
    useful base; it is not proof of the full DIDAR/SUPPLIER/RETAILER
    scope or Agent assignment rules.
-   Extend frontend catalog actions to Product-and-quantity requests,
    with real API error states. Do not retain native supplier selection
    or immediate-stock checkout semantics.
-   Add structured status/audit history and query filters at the
    required reporting grain. Native timestamps and ProductChange
    actions alone do not demonstrate compliance with
    REPORTING-FOUNDATION.

## 4. Where custom modules are required

Proposed domain boundaries, subject to each package's implementation
map:

-   Organization/membership and Didar permission resolver where native
    seller/customer identity is insufficient.
-   Physical Intake and Physical Item/UID traceability.
-   Supply Order and supplier commercial/payment-term snapshots.
-   Order request, internal supply allocations, versioned proforma and
    retailer acceptance gate.
-   Packaging and dispatch/custody extensions that preserve Package →
    Physical Item and Shipment → 1..N same-retailer Invoices.
-   Agent bags, authorized retailers, custody and direct-sale context.
-   Settlement Policy, separate supplier/retailer obligations and
    append-oriented 18K-gold ledger; balance calculated from entries.
-   Invoice/Invoice Line → physical UID and immutable commercial
    history.
-   Shared audit/status-history capability where native history is
    insufficient.

Do not implement these domains together now. Full WMS, Shelf/Bin/Cycle
Count, B2C and optional packaging-material inventory remain deferred.

## 5. Core areas that should remain untouched

Keep `packages/core`, native Medusa tables/services, generic
authentication, checkout and framework tooling unchanged for Didar
business features. Prefer application modules, links, workflows/hooks,
scoped APIs and dashboard extension points.

Native upstream patch files already exist in this clean commit:
`@medusajs+core-flows@2.18.0.patch` and
`@medusajs+core-flows@2.21.0-payment-hooks.patch`. They are part of
official Mercur, not imports from the old Didar project. Do not add
old-project patches or disable these native patches to conceal a
failure.

Do not run stock-reserving native checkout before retailer acceptance.
Do not turn supplier cost terms into customer terms, mutate historical
transactions from live Offer reads, equate quantity inventory with
physical UIDs, or substitute manually editable balances for a ledger.

## 6. Unchanged build and run status

**Earlier Work-environment observation (superseded by the verified local
runtime above): Build/Run could not be proven in that environment.**

Root commands are `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, `bun run build`,
`bun run dev`, `bun run test:unit` and `bun run test:integration:http`.
The root Turbo build is not the whole application gate: `apps/api`,
`apps/admin-test` and `apps/vendor` have no build script, so explicit
API build and host Vite builds are also required. Storefront
`next.config.ts` sets `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors = true`; a
successful Next build alone would not establish a clean typecheck.

Next verification, without feature edits: complete frozen installation;
provision isolated PostgreSQL/Redis and development environment values;
build packages/API/dashboard hosts/storefront; apply native migrations;
run native seed against disposable data; test health/catalog/auth,
server restart and direct page refresh. Record exact results before
starting P01. No lockfile changes, dependency downgrades, source fixes
or old-project workarounds have been used.
